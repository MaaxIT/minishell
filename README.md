# minishell
My own little bash shell made in C for School42.  
I called it **SuperShell** because it's a super shell (from my pov ofc) :)

## Installation
Two steps:
1. Use ``make`` to compile
2. Use ``./minishell`` to run

And here you go, you can type any command you want and it should act the same as bash!

## Warning
This is a school project.
Don't use it.
